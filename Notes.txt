NOTES:

----------Functional Requirements----------
1: List all termini in the MTR network
	1.1: For each MTR Line in the network, list ALL termini
2: List all stations in a line in the MTR network
	2.1: For a MTR Line, list all the station stops
3: List all lines that are directly connected to a line
	3.1 In a lone, list out ALL connecting lines
		eg: Island Line = Tsuen Wan Line, South Island Line, Tseung Kwan O Line
4: Find a path between two stations
	4.1: Find a path between two stations
	4.2: Data Structure - Stack

----------Non-Functional Requirements----------
1. The processing of each query must be done in linear time (i.e. O(n)) or less. Depending on the query, n may be the number of lines or the total number of stations in the given MTR network.
2. A user will interact with the system through the given Text-based User Interface (TUI), with all output being displayed by the standard output stream.
3. The display of results for each query must be clear and easy to understand.
4. The application must be robust and display appropriate messages should any run time errors (e.g. no result found) occur.
