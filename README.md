Similar to the London Underground, MTR is made up of a set of interconnected lines. Each
MTR line has at least two termini (i.e. the stations at the two ends of a train route). While
most lines in the network contains a single sequence of stations, some lines (e.g. Tseung
Kwan O Line and East Rail Line) have branches along the line. Figure 1 shows a map
of the MTR system. While theoretically, once entered the MTR network, an MTR passenger
can get to anywhere within the network. However, navigating within the network (especially
when one is unfamiliar with the network) can be fairly tricky. It is therefore helpful
if there would be an Information Centre available to help passengers learn more about the
network.
